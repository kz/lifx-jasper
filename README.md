# lifx-jasper
lifx-jasper is a [Jasper](http://jasperproject.github.io/) module built to control all of your LIFX lights using your voice.

The reason for building this project is because I have a single LIFX light situated in my bedroom which I would like to control using my voice. Therefore, this repository will not have the handling of individual lights in mind, although it may be something I will consider in the future.

## Code Example
Code examples will be included once this project is functional.

## Installation
1. Navigate to `~/jasper/client/modules` folder, assuming that your Jasper files are situated under your home directory
2. Download a release and move `Light.py` into the modules folder.
3. Boot Jasper and you should be ready to go!
